<p>GREENVILLE, SC (FOX Carolina) - The Shriners Hospital for Children in Greenville said the largest toy delivery of the holiday season will take place on Monday.

The Carolina GM Association, a car club dedicated to preserving and restoring classic GM vehicles, makes a huge toy donation every year during Christmastime.

The hospital said patients will watch in awe as the GM Association crew and hospital workers gather to help unpack and sort the thousands of toys.

The toys range from dolls and games to bikes and balls, and will be given to every patient who has an appointment at the hospital in the weeks before Christmas.</p>

<h2><b>Australian Border Force detects asbestos in classic cars, owners risk thousands of dollars in fines</b></h1>

<p>DEADLY asbestos is being detected in an increasing number of privately imported classic cars — and unwary buyers are risking thousands of dollars in fines and repairs.
Australian Border Force has intercepted more than 50 classic and vintage cars containing asbestos parts so far this year, almost twice as many as the same period last year.
Valuable collector cars such as Ford Mustangs, Rolls-Royces, Bentleys and Jaguars — most of which are more than 40 years old — have been caught in the Customs crackdown.
Individual importers risk fines of more than $3000 per offence, but the biggest expense is getting car parts tested and replaced.
Importers must pay for the testing of suspect parts and then replace them with asbestos-free components before the vehicle can clear Customs — a process that can take months and cost in excess of $20,000.
“Recent history has shown a high incidence of imports in the classic car sector where asbestos has been found in parts such as brake pads, clutch linings and gaskets from vintage and veteran cars,” said Stephen Hledik, the acting commander of Customs Compliance in the Australian Border Force.
“If the Australian Border Force suspects there is asbestos present in the goods being imported we will instruct the importer to arrange for testing at their cost. That involves extra cost to them as well as delays as the testing is conducted,” said Mr Hledik.
“It’s the responsibility of the importer to make sure the asbestos parts have been removed before importing the car into Australia. Importers need to be aware that Australia’s total ban on asbestos (introduced in 2003) means zero per cent asbestos content.”
News Corp Australia has spoken to three private importers who’ve been caught out by the recent detection of classic cars containing asbestos, but none wanted to comment publicly.
One importer said testing and repairs cost him $14,500, another said the process set him back $25,000. Another importer said he was $10,000 out of pocket.
